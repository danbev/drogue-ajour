= Architecture

Drogue Ajour is composed of 2 main components serving different functions:

* _Firmware Delivery_ - Transporting firmware updates to devices.
* _Firmware Build_ - Building and storing firmware artifacts.

Of these, only the firmware delivery component is mandatory. However, deploying both of these components provide you with an end to end Continuous Delivery (CD) pipeline for your devices.

== Firmware delivery

Firmware delivery is the main functionality of Drogue Ajour. This involves transporting the firmware to devices using a CBOR-based protocol. The transport protocol is designed for minimal overhead, and to allow devices to consume updates at their own pace.

The firmware itself can be fetched from disk, Eclipse Hawkbit or a Docker/Container registry.

== Firmware build

This is an optional component that allow you to build your firmware and make it available to the delivery component for rolling out to your devices.
