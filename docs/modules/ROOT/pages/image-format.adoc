= Container image format

When using a container registry, the container image must contain the following two files in the root of the image:

* `firmware.bin` - This is the firmware artifact to be delivered
* `firmware.json` - This is a manifest with metadata of the firmware

An example `firmware.json` manifest looks like this:

----
{
  "version": "2dbedf0",
  "size": 7716,
  "checksum": "2e8db6036411adccba75dd5a0316e6ab72402351478a35ac5a452d4cf6371c8f"
}
----
As long as these two files are present, Drogue Ajour will be able to deliver the firmware to devices.
