# Drogue Ajour (Ã  jour => updated)

The Drogue Ajour is an add-on for Drogue IoT Cloud that allows you to manage firmware updates for a fleet of devices for Drogue IoT Cloud applications. It can be used to monitor all applications accessible by a Drogue Cloud access token, or a single application.

You can run Drogue Ajour locally or on Kubernetes (recommended for production).

# Installation

Download one of the install bundles, extract and apply the resource manifests for each component:

```
kubectl apply -f deploy/server
kubectl apply -f deploy/console
kubectl apply -f deploy/pipeline
```

In addition, you will need to create secrets for accessing additional services (you may omit those you don't need, but you might need to adjust the environment variables in the deployments as well):

```
kubectl create secret drogue-config --from-literal=client-id=<OIDC client id> --from-literal=issuer-url=<OIDC issuer URL> --from-literal=mqtt-integration=<mqtt integration endpoint hostname> --from-literal=registry-url=<drogue device registry url> --from-literal=user=<drogue access token user> --from-literal=token=<drogue access token>

# If using container registry for storing firmware
kubectl create secret generic container-registry --from-literal=prefix=localhost:5000/ --from-literal=token=<registry access token>

# If using Eclipse Hawkbit
kubectl create secret hawkbit-config --from-literal=gateway-token=<gateway token> --from-literal=tenant=<hawkbit tenant>
```

## Architecture

Drogue Ajour uses the Drogue IoT Cloud event stream and command API to communicate with devices that have firmware update capability. The Drogue IoT device registry is used to store the 'desired' firmware and version for a given device. The `Application` and `Device` objects need to use an extended schema as follows:

```
spec:
  firmware:
    oci:
      image: 'image-within-repo:1234'
```


If defined at the `Application` it will apply to all devices unless there is a per device property, in which case that will override the application level property.

As a reference architecture, Drogue Ajour uses an Open Container Initiative (OCI) registry to store container images with the device firmware. This allows reusing existing infrastructure commonly used in Kubernetes. However, Drogue Ajour also integrates with Eclipse Hawkbit for storing the firmware (see below).

Building and deploying firmware is decoupled from the Drogue Ajour, as long as the expected manifest format can be retrieved from a firmware metadata (in case of OCI, as a label on the container image). As a reference architecture,
a [tekton](tekton.dev) pipeline is used to show how you can build and deploy firmware to an OCI registry.

The Drogue IoT Application and Device objects contain custom properties that define the desired firmware version that each device (or all) should be served.

### Hawkbit integration

To use the Hawkbit integration instead of OCI, the schema is extended as follows:

```
spec:
  firmware:
    hawkbit:
      controller: mycontroller
```

## Protocol

Drogue Ajour uses a custom application level protocol sent on the 'dfu' channel and 'dfu' command to communicate with a device or gateway. The protocol is stateless, meaning that Drogue Ajour will track only send out firmware updates to devices that are reporting their status.

The protocol is designed so that devices do not have to be online continuously during the update, but can receive firmware at their own pace.

The protocol uses Consise Binary Object Representation (CBOR), to ensure a small message size that works well with embedded devices. For descriptive purposes, the examples here are provided in JSON, with CBOR values to follow once implementation has started.

A typical firmware update cycle runs as follows:

1. At any given time, a device publishes message to the 'dfu' channel with the following payload

```
{
   "version": "0.1.0",
   "correlation_id": 1 // Optional: Opaque request identifier, for devices that aggregate multiple updates
   "mtu": 512, // Optional: The desired block size to use for firmware blobs
}
```

This allows the Drogue Ajour to check if an update is necessary at all.

2. Drogue Ajour checks the desired firmware for that particular device and will attempt to locate it in the firmware registry.

3a. If the device is already updated, a 'dfu' command is sent to the device with the following payload:

```
{
  "sync": {
    "version": "0.1.0", // Desired firmware version
    "correlation_id": 1 // Optional: Should be set to the id from the device status
    "poll": 300, // The amount of time to wait before checking in again
  }
}
```

3b. If a device needs to be updated, a 'dfu' command is sent to the device with the following payload

```
{
  "write": {
    "version": "0.1.1", // Version of blob
    "offset": 0, // Offset this blob should be written to
    "data": aGVsbG8= // Base64-encoded firmware block (Binary in CBOR)
  }
}
```

3c. If there is no new information about firmware, and server needs the client to wait before asking again, a 'wait' command is sent.

```
{
  "write": {
    "poll": 300, // The amount of time to wait before checking in again
  }
}
```

4a. When a device is seeing the "sync" operation, it should make sure it's current firmware version is marked as 'good' if it have not already done so. The 'poll' field can be used as a heuristic of how long the device should wait before checking in again.

4b. When a device is seeing the "write" operation, it should write the provided data to it's storage. Once persisted, it should report back the next expected offset and last received version:

```
{
   "version": "0.1.0",
   "mtu": 512, // The desired block size to use for the next firmware block
   "status": {
      "version": "0.1.1", // Version of the last block the device received from the server. To safeguard against new versions arriving
      "offset": 512, // Current write offset after applying the last firmware block.
   }
}
```

5b. When the server receives the next event from the device, it repeats step 4b. until the complete firmware have been sent. When the final block is confirmed written, and it is desired to deploy the new firmware, the fleet-manager will send the following command:

```
{
  "swap": {
    "version": "0.1.1",
    "checksum": "097d501382f5817eb2c5f741d37845158c76dd6a8af899001b36b5a75188aeeb"
  }
}
```

6b. When the device receives the 'swap' command, it should initiate the firmware update and report back with the updated version as soon as it's back online.

## Client

The [`drgdfu`](https://github.com/drogue-iot/drgdfu) implements the above protocol, either using a file as the server or using the Drogue IoT cloud endpoints acting as a gateway device.
